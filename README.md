# SberTaste

This project is our final work at the end of the course "Java Developer" by SberUniversity.

It represents a REST-app to order pizza online.

The following tech stack was implemented here:

0. Java 11 (Maven project);
1. Spring Boot 2.7.7;
2. Spring Security (by JWT token);
3. Spring Data JPA;
4. Liquibase library;
5. PostgreSQL;
6. JUnit5;
7. Mockito;
8. Docker;
9. Swagger.

There are 2 main user stories in this app: 
* for a customer -> pizza order, 
* for an employee (manager or director) -> management of the work flow.
